# AIDIA
AIDIA (AI Document Interactive Assistant) is a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5-Turbo that uses embeddings to index a file and enables users to interact with a document using natural language.

## To run a Python code, you can follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the command:
```git clone https://github.com/inproxima/AIDIA.git```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the ```app.py``` file using the command:
```cd <repository>/path/to/app.py```

3. Install any necessary Python dependencies using pip. Typically, this is done by creating a virtual environment and activating it before running:
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # for Linux or MacOS
env\Scripts\activate.bat   # for Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Start the Streamlit app using the command:
```streamlit run app.py```
This should launch the app in your default web browser at ```http://localhost:8501``` 

That's it! You should now be able to view and interact with PEARL in your web browser.
